# Getting Started

Welcome to your new project. It contains a few files and folders following our **recommended project layout**:


File / Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`srv/` | your models and code go here
`db/` | your database content goes here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this readme


The following sections are a quick walkthrough of essential tasks:

## Define your first Service and Run it

Create a file [srv/cat-service.cds](srv/cat-service.cds) and define a service in there as follows:

```swift
using { Country, managed } from '@sap/cds/common';

service CatalogService {

  entity Books {
    key ID : Integer;
    title  : localized String;
    author : Association to Authors;
    stock  : Integer;
  }

  entity Authors {
    key ID : Integer;
    name   : String;
    books  : Association to many Books on books.author = $self;
  }

  entity Orders : managed {
    key ID  : UUID;
    book    : Association to Books;
    country : Country;
    amount  : Integer;
  }
}
```


**[Run that](command:cds.run)** in a terminal to start a generic server:
```sh
> cds run
```

_Cmd/Ctrl-click_ on the link _<http://localhost:4004>_ in the output to open a browser and send requests to your service using the provided links.



## Add Data Models

Above we used a simplistic 'all-in-one' service definition for a quick start. Usually, you would put your entity definitions into a separate data model and have your **services expose views** on that entities.

Create a file named [db/data-model.cds](db/data-model.cds) and fill it with that:

```swift
namespace my.bookshop;
using { Country, managed } from '@sap/cds/common';

entity Books {
  key ID : Integer;
  title  : localized String;
  author : Association to Authors;
  stock  : Integer;
}

entity Authors {
  key ID : Integer;
  name   : String;
  books  : Association to many Books on books.author = $self;
}

entity Orders : managed {
  key ID  : UUID;
  book    : Association to Books;
  country : Country;
  amount  : Integer;
}
```

With that we can adapt our [srv/cat-service.cds](srv/cat-service.cds) to exposing views as follows:

```swift
using my.bookshop as my from '../db/data-model';

service CatalogService {
  entity Books    @readonly as projection on my.Books;
  entity Authors  @readonly as projection on my.Authors;
  entity Orders @insertonly as projection on my.Orders;
}
```


## Add Databases

The `cds` runtime ships with built-in generic handlers which automatically serve all CRUD requests SQL databases. We choose _sqlite_ for dev usage as that is already available on Macs ([&rarr; install it on Windows](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)):

```bash
npm i sqlite3 -D
```

Now we can deploy our data model to a sqlite database:

```bash
cds deploy --to sqlite:my.db
```

This creates a sqlite database file at _[my.db](my.db)_. In addition, the given configuration is stored to your _package.json_ as your default data source. With that, you can run `cds deploy` subsquently without any arguments.



## Add Initial Data

Add plain CSV files under `db/csv` to fill your database tables with initial data.

1. Add a filed called [db/csv/my.bookshop-Authors.csv](db/csv/my.bookshop-Authors.csv) and add the following data:
```csv
ID;name
101;Emily Brontë
107;Charlote Brontë
150;Edgar Allen Poe
170;Richard Carpenter
```

2. Add a file called [db/csv/my.bookshop-Books.csv](db/csv/my.bookshop-Books.csv) and add the following data
```csv
ID;title;author_ID;stock
201;Wuthering Heights;101;12
207;Jane Eyre;107;11
251;The Raven;150;333
252;Eleonora;150;555
271;Catweazle;170;22
```

Run [`cds deploy`](command:cds.deploy)  again to have the data filled in.

Then [`cds run`](command:cds.run) the server again and see the data returned.

As we have now a fully cabable SQL database connected, we can leverage the querying capabilities of the generic handlers with requests like that: [.../Authors?$expand=books($select=ID,title)](http://localhost:4004/catalog/Authors?$expand=books($select=ID,title))



## Add Custom Logic
( Example for Node.js, skip for Java )

So far, all requests were served automatically by built-in generic service providers.
You can hook in to these providers to add your domain-specific logic. Just add an equally named `.js` file next to your service definition, i.e. [srv/cat-service.js](srv/cat-service.js), and fill this in:

```js
module.exports = (srv) => {

  const {Books} = cds.entities ('my.bookshop')

  // Reduce stock of ordered books
  srv.before ('CREATE', 'Orders', async (req) => {
    const order = req.data
    if (!order.amount || order.amount <= 0)  return req.error (400, 'Order at least 1 book')
    const tx = cds.transaction(req)
    const affectedRows = await tx.run (
      UPDATE (Books)
        .set   ({ stock: {'-=': order.amount}})
        .where ({ stock: {'>=': order.amount},/*and*/ ID: order.book_ID})
    )
    if (affectedRows === 0)  req.error (409, "Sold out, sorry")
  })

  // Add some discount for overstocked books
  srv.after ('READ', 'Books', each => {
    if (each.stock > 111)  each.title += ' -- 11% discount!'
  })

}
```

- Just open [.../Books](http://localhost:4004/catalog/Books) in the browser to test the handler for `Books`.

- For the `Orders` handler, you can use this [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=bin) command (or use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) with the data from below):
  ```sh
  curl http://localhost:4004/catalog/Orders -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"book_ID":201, "amount":6}'
  ```

  After a few more requests the `Sold out` response is returned since the stock would drop below `0`.
